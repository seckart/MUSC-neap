		External Horizontal Analysis
	</h1>

	<p>
		HealthLinx<sup>&reg;</sup> defines External Horizontal dynamics as those dynamics that are Unit &amp;/or Leader-specific and that can be fairly compared to other hospitals' similar units. For example an Emergency Department where both the Director and Manager are vacant would represent a significant threat to care in the ED.
	</p>

	<p>
		The market radius was defined as 50 miles.
	</p>

	<p>
		MUSC has nearly 70 FTE nurse vacancies, more than double all of Roper St Francis Health combined.

		External Horizontal Analysis
	</h1>

	<p>
		HealthLinx<sup>&reg;</sup> defines External Horizontal dynamics as those dynamics that are Unit &amp;/or Leader-specific and that can be fairly compared to other hospitals' similar units. For example an Emergency Department where both the Director and Manager are vacant would represent a significant threat to care in the ED.
	</p>

	<p>
		The market was defined as 45 miles, with hospitals of similarly staffed bed size (200-575).
	</p>

	<p>
		As compared to the hospitals in the selected area, Winchester appears to have far more leadership vacancies. Further, the RN vacancy is greater.

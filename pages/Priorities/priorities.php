		Priorities

	<p>
		The ANCCâ€™s Commission on Magnet<sup>&reg;</sup> makes all final designation decisions. To be deemed worthy of being a Magnet Designated Facility means that an organization has met and exceeded quality thresholds and a number of other qualifying standards for culture, professional development, and leadership excellence. Some of the most challenging of thresholds are the expectations of outperforming the 50th percentile of a national database on more than 50% of eligible units for the most recent 8 quarters for patient satisfaction, RN satisfaction, and NSIs. In addition, facilities must meet the minimum expectation for Research, Education, and Certification.
	</p>

	<p>
		With that stated, HealthLinx<sup>&reg;</sup> makes the assumption with all projects that improved financial performance is also a "minimum requirement."
	</p>

	<p>
		Thus, this creates the "Top 6" upon which to focus as we prioritize:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>RN Engagement</li>
		<li>Patient Satisfaction</li>
		<li>NSIs</li>
		<li>Research and Education</li>
		<li>Certification</li>
		<li>Positive Financial Impact</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Although there are many more requirements, these are needed in order to be considered excellent and worthy of Designation.
	</p>

	<p>
		Therefore, the leadership of every facility pursuing Magnet<sup>&reg;</sup> must ask themselves this fundamental question:
	</p>

	<p>
		"Is our goal to meet the minimum or exceed it and if answer is exceed it?" If the answer is "exceed it," then "by how much"?
	</p>

	<p>
		The answer to this question drives all prioritization from here forward. For this section, the following prioritization will be based on the assumption of simply meeting the minimum.
	</p>

	<p>
		Throughout the data gathering and analysis, HealthLinx<sup>&reg;</sup> has organized challenges and opportunities into two categories:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Vertical or facility-wide</li>
		<li>Horizontal or Unit/Leader-Specific</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		In order to meet the minimum thresholds for the "Top 6," suggest both Vertical and Horizontal action steps. The action plan recipe is simple: problem solve vertically and horizontally and you'll exceed the threshold.

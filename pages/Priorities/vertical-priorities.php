					The following are the most important Vertical challenges and opportunities with regard to nursing excellence and Initial Magnet<sup>&reg; Designation:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Nurse Engagement must be improved. This is the hallmark of a Magnet<sup>&reg;</sup> facility. The Vertical solution is to be more precise with category selection, communicate the chosen categories and finally accountability. The Horizontal solution is to close critical leadership vacancies, investigate underperformance, stretch coverage and front line leadership.
					</li>
					<li>
						Nurse Satisfaction or Engagement Survey (most recent).
					</li>
					<li>
						Education &amp; Certification, specifically, Job Descriptions for: CNO, Nursing Director, Nurse Manager, APRN, and Clinical Nurse.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The projected financial impact of the above over four years is $14,250,984.

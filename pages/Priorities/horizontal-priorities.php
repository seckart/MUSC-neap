				<p>
					The following are the most important Horizontal challenges and opportunities with regard to nursing excellence and Initial Magnet<sup>&reg;</sup> Designation:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						There is a strong hypothesis that the poorly performing Patient satisfaction in the bottom performing units or all the unit that have poorly performing Patient Satisfaction is being caused by the lack of leadership on the unit level, for example the noted vacancies, underperformance, frontline issues and/or stretch.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the same leadership issues plaguing RN Engagement could be solved, facility could realistically see over performance in 26 out of 29 units (93%) versus the current 15 out of 29 (52%). Such a change would be strong evidence of the facilityâ€™s commitment to excellence.
					</li>
					<li>
						The lack of a Director or Manager in the Operating Room is likely causing its poor performance in all three domains and is possibly a financial risk to the facility.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the Emergency Room LWOBS performance could be reduced to the state mean and LOS improved, it is projected that facility could realize $3,909,956 over a four-year period.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					In addition to the hypothetical improvements outlined here and additionally considering facility's unique location, as noted in the External Vertical Analysis, with no other competitor being Magnet<sup>&reg;</sup> Designated within 40 miles, truly positions facility as the standard bearer for Nursing Excellence in that corner intersection of Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland.

		Writing and Publication Threats
	</p>

	<p>
		The Assessment did not evaluate the ability of the current writing team. This is therefore an unknown and to-be-evaluated resource and a risk to this project's completion. Evaluation of the writing team will be completed prior to first-scheduled writing intensive.
	</p>

	<p>
		Due to the time needed for writing, content and copy editing, and publication, this creates a writing schedule from <span class="bold">September 2016</span> through <span class="bold">July 2017</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Publication is on a schedule similar to that for writing. Since publication can only be completed after writing, the "Writing" threats mentioned above also threaten publication.

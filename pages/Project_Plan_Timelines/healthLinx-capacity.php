		HealthLinx<sup>&reg;</sup> Capacity
	</h1>

	<p>
		Before all projects are planned, reviews its capacity and its ability to deliver the necessary resources.
	</p>

	<p>
		Because of the time needed to resolve remaining risks and document production (including writing, content and copy editing, and publication), the workload for this project spans from April 2016 through October 2017.
	</p>

	<p>
		To meet this project's demands, HealthLinx<sup>&reg;</sup> has assigned a VP Nursing Excellence, Project Management (VPNE) to manage the overall project.
	</p>

	<p>
		Given our capacity to partner with you, it is critical to adhere to the mutually agreed upon timelines and deadlines that have been created. Any deviation from the plan may threaten your goals. Capacity may not be available in subsequent months if Facility misses deliverables. Facility will be responsible for such deviations and the consequences they may have for its efforts. Deadline penalties are included to further encourage Facility to meet all deadlines.

	<p>
		Strategic plans for nursing and the organization are requested in the Organizational Overview (OO) of submitted documents. Placement of these foundational documents in the OO is purposeful as they are not scored but rather a “pass/fail” in that they are required prior to ongoing appraiser assessment. With that in mind, the following represents a short list of what constitutes effective strategic plans:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Establishes a logical focus on initiatives that drive organizational outcomes
		</li>
		<li>
			Organizational and Nursing Strategic Plans mirror goals, priorities, and strategies to reach those goals.
		</li>
		<li>
			Inclusive of strategic partners from the bedside through executive leadership
		</li>
		<li>
			Creative, innovative tactics that nursing can champion
		</li>
		<li>
			Organizational Mission, Vision, and Core Values should be evidenced through inclusive strategic initiatives.
		</li>
	</ul>

		"Gentlemen, we will chase perfection, and we will chase it relentlessly, knowing all the while we can never attain it. But along the way, we shall catch excellence."

	At HealthLinx<sup>&reg;</sup> we are committed to partnering with organizations who are committed to the pursuit of excellence- not to be confused with the pursuit of an award. Once a foundational culture of excellence is enculturated, , nurtured, and empirically proven over time, the next logical step is recognition and celebration. The Magnet Recognition Award<sup>&reg;</sup> recognizes organizations who have the ability to attract and retain highly competent nurses who consistently deliver superior, innovative care as evidenced through nationally benchmarked quality indicators.

	<p>
		Defining words such as "journey" and "pursuit" are purposefully infinite- the chase is relentless.

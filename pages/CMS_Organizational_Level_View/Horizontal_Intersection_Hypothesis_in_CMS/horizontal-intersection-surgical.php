		Horizontal Intersection Hypothesis in CMS - Surgical
	</h1>

	<p>
		As is also noted in the"Leadership Vacancy Hypothesis" subsection of the "Horizontal Intersection Hypothesis in the ULSO", section the lack of both a Director and Manager in the Operating Room is of particular concern, especially for preventable VTE. No monetization of the lack of leadership in in the Operating Room is completed in this analysis. However, most Operating Rooms significantly contribute to a facility’s margin. It is our hypothesis that the facility’s margin is at risk.

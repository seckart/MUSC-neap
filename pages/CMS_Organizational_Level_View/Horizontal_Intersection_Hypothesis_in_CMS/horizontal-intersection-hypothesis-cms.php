		Horizontal Intersection Hypothesis in CMS
	</h1>

	<p>
		The continual assessment of strategic and quality plans for nursing and patient outcomes is a hallmark of Magnet<sup>&reg;</sup>-recognized organizations.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Strong, knowledgeable, transformational nursing leaders provide the structure for establishing this level of nursing excellence.
	</p>	
	
	<p>
		Unit-level clinical directors and managers are accountable for nursing and patient outcome measures.
	</p>	

	<p>
		Connecting the nursing leadership to the outcome is one way to identify leadership challenges at the unit level. Because CMS data is mostly at the organizational-level, it is far easier to make these connections using the ULSO or at the unit-level. However, the CMS data can be valuable in making Horizontal hypotheses in two distinct ways:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>If the data is unit-specific, for example there are several Unit-Level measures for the Emergency Department, like "Left before being seen" ("LOS") or "Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Admitted ED Patients" ("LWOBS")</li>
		<li>To further confirm or substantiate Horizontal challenges discovered using the ULSO</li>
	</ol>

		The Clinical Process of Care domain accounts for 10% domain weight in FY 2016. In this domain, for FY 2016, the measures which contribute to the domain score include data points in the Surgical Care Improvement Project, Preventative Care, Pneumonia, and Heart Attack data sets. While not all data points listed in the Timely &amp; Effective Care data directly impact the CPOC domain, they do directly impact the Readmissions and Death Rates, Complications, and Hospital-Associated Infections (HAIs/HACs) which are recognized in the Outcomes domain (40% domain weight), as well as the separate Readmissions &amp; Deaths penalty and the Hospital Acquired Conditions (HAC) penalty.

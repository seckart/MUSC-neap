		Vertical Financial Impact Opportunities
	</h1>

	<p>
		Views Vertical Financial Impacts, i.e., decreased expenses, increased virtual capacity, increased revenue, mitigated risks or penalties avoided, as those impacts that are caused by facility-wide actions.
	</p>

	<p>
		With regard to this facility's Initial Designation, would expect facility to reap the benefits of Reduced Turnover, Falls, HAPU and Needle Sticks commensurate with other Magnet<sup>&reg;</sup> facilities. In addition, facility should see the corresponding financial benefits of these reductions shown below. These achievements should be sustained in the constant pursuit of excellence exhibited by Magnet<sup>&reg;</sup> facilities over the fours until Redesignation. The reduction with the largest financial impact is the reduction of RN Turnover. This reduction is projected to create a 4-year benefit of $13,546,208.

		RN satisfaction or lack of satisfaction is currently the largest Vertical challenge, with RN Satisfaction not outperforming threshold. A foundational Magnet<sup>&reg;</sup> principle is that highly engaged nurses have better quality (NSIs) and happy patients (Patient Satisfaction).

	<p>
		Typically, turnover and the corresponding financial impact is considered a Vertical impact. However, and as is discussed in the Internal Horizontal Analysis, there is a strong indication that 5 of the bottom 6 performers and their lack of satisfaction may have more to do with leadership vacancy. Further, the lack of satisfaction for the next cohort at the bottom may have more to do with a particular Director. Finally, either "stretch" coverage or frontline nurse leadership may better explain the dissatisfaction of the third cohort from the bottom.

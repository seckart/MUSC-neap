		External Vertical Analysis
	</h1>

	<p>
	HealthLinx<sup>&reg;</sup> defines Vertical dynamics as a hospital-wide &amp;/or systemic dynamic. Using publicly reported data, HCAHPS can offer a perspective on patient satisfaction data in comparison to peers. Improving this status has many benefits, including the likely improvement in the market of the desirability of being employed at your hospital (lower staff and leadership turnover, higher retention).

	<p>
		While there do seem to be several Magnet hospitals in the market radius, the closest one that is not a VA medical center is 40 miles away. This puts Winchester in a premier position to be the standard bearer for Nursing Excellence in that corner intersection of Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland. Magnet redesignation, along with continued performance improvement in the areas of re-admissions as well as patient satisfaction, will yield not only improved Value-Based Purchasing performance, but strengthen Winchester's competitive position in the market radius.

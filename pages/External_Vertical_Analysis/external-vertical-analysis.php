		External Vertical Analysis
	</h1>

	<p>
	HealthLinx<sup>&reg;</sup> defines Vertical dynamics as a hospital-wide &amp;/or systemic dynamic. Using publicly reported data, HCAHPS can offer a perspective on patient satisfaction data in comparison to peers. Improving this status has many benefits, including the likely improvement in the market of the desirability of being employed at your hospital (lower staff and leadership turnover, higher retention).

		Based on the current and future Magnet status of the main hospitals in the greater Charleston area, a line has been drawn between MUSC and the Roper St Francis Health System for both Nursing Excellence and leadership talent acquisition. MUSC only has 1 main campus hospital while Roper has 3, all of which are within a 15 mile radius of MUSC, and going on Magnet journeys (either initial or re-designation). If successful, Roper will have strength in nursing excellence and culture across 3 hospitals in Charleston at the system-wide level that could potentially leave MUSC behind.

 	<p>
		With the status of Roper St Francis Health’s hospitals still not Magnet designated system-wide, MUSC needs to not only successfully re-designate as Magnet, but outperform Magnet in order to beat Roper on the leadership level as well and draw the best staff candidates to them versus any of Roper’s facilities. The four main hospitals in Charleston all going for Magnet in some way will shortly become a competition for recruiting the best and brightest talent. The potential with a successful re-designation – and an outperformance of Magnet standards – to stay on top of the local marketplace is huge, and an opportunity that MUSC simply cannot afford to miss.

		Stretch Coverage Hypothesis
	</h1>

	<p>
		It is worth noting at least two possible Horizontal hypotheses about what may be negatively affecting the Vertical domain of RN Satisfaction.
	</p>

	<p>
		All of the units being led by Director Janet Nordling are outperforming the threshold. Her leadership is contributing 9 outperforming units to the total of 15 outperforming units, or 52%.
	</p>

	<p>
		However, there appears to be a Vertical drag on RN Satisfaction in units 111-115.
	</p>

	<p>
		The two possible hypotheses are:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			The frontline leadership of Nurse Manager Nicole Ryder represents four of the five where RN Satisfaction is underperforming
		</li>
		<li>
			The Women's and Children's units that are being led by Janet Nordling have much higher RN Satisfaction than 111-115, which may indicate a "stretch" coverage problem
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		In either event, RN Satisfaction is a hallmark of a Magnet<sup>&reg;</sup> facility. At Winchester, RN Satisfaction is the only domain not outperforming. If the cause of nursing frustration could be resolved, with everything else held constant, Winchester would be outperforming in all three domains (RN Sat., NSI and Pat. Sat.).

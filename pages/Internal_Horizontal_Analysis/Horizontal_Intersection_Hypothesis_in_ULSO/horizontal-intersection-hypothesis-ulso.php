		Horizontal Intersection Hypothesis in ULSO
	</h1>

	<p>
		According to the Magnet Application Manual<sup>&reg;</sup>, outperformance, outperformance is measured as more than 50% of the units outperforming the benchmark more than 50% of the time for 8 quarters.
	</p>

	<p>
		Outperformance can be affected both Vertically and Horizontally.
	</p>

	<p>
		The three most frequent tactics utilized to affect outcomes Horizontally are:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Assure there are no leadership vacancies</li>
		<li>Explore "Stretch Coverage" hypothesis</li>
		<li>Explore leadership underperformance hypothesis</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		When either a Director, Manager, or both are absent, stretched or ineffective:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Unit-level (Horizontal) and Facility-Wide (Vertical) Outcomes are threatened</li>
		<li>Transformation cannot be expected</li>
		<li>Action plans to address unit performance cannot be operationalized</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	Ultimately, lack of leadership is a threat to Magnet<sup>&reg;</sup> Designation.

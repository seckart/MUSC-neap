		Leadership Vacancy Hypothesis
	</h1>

	<p>
		Currently, 4 Director and 6 Nurse Manager positions appear to be vacant.
	</p>

	<p>
		The following are the Open Nursing Leadership Positions:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Clinical Manager – Critical Care (as listed on organizational chart)</li>
		<li>Clinical Manager – Step-down (as listed on organizational chart)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The following positions were listed as vacant on the leadership cross-walk:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Operating Room – Director and Manager</li>
		<li>Behavioral Health – Manager</li>
		<li>Chronic Disease Resource Center – Manager</li>
		<li>Post Anesthesia Care Unit – Director</li>
		<li>Surgi-Center – Manager</li>
		<li>AM Admission – Director</li>
		<li>START Clinic – Director</li>
		<li>Home Health – Manager</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The lack of both a Director and Manager in the Operating Room is of particular concern.
	</p>

	<p>
		When viewing the bottom six underperforming units, there appears to be a striking intersection of Vertical underperformance in all three domains (RN Sat., NSI & Patient Sat.) and Horizontal vacancy or lack of leadership.
	</p>

	<p>
		Three of the six bottom performing units lack a Director and underperform in all three domains.
	</p>

	<p>
		Two of the six bottom performing units lack a Nurse Manager and underperform in all three domains.
	</p>

	<p>
		One of the six bottom performing units lacks both a Director and a Nurse Manager and underperforms in all three domains.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is hypothesized that if the Horizontal lack of Leadership in the bottom six units were corrected, while holding all the other unit performances constant, instead of Winchester having:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>15 out of 29 or 52% of the units outperforming in RN Satisfaction, Winchester could be outperforming in 21out of 29 or 72%.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Such a change would help to exceed the threshold and would reflect operational nursing excellence throughout the organization.

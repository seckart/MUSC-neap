		Underperformance Hypothesis
	</h1>

	<p>
		There are six units (102, 104, 106, 108, 110 &amp; 144, 149-151) that are underperforming the threshold. Interestingly, three of the six are at 50%, or 1% from overperformance. Problem-solving around leadership challenges in these areas could represent some easy wins, allowing Winchester to meet the threshold.
	</p>

	<p>
		If the root causes of the underperformance in the three units at 50% could be resolved, then instead of 15 out of 29 (52%) outperforming, 18 out 29 (62%) could be outperforming. Again, that is holding every other measure constant.

		If the root causes of the underperformance in all six units highlighted below could be resolved, then instead of 15 out of 29 (52%) outperforming, 21 out 29 (72%) could be outperforming. Again, that is holding every other measure constant.

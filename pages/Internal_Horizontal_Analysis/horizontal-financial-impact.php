		Horizontal Financial Impact
	</h1>

	<p>
		There are two Horizontal Financial Impact hypotheses.
	</p>

	<p>
	As noted in both the CMS View and the "Horizontal Intersection Hypothesis in ULSO," "Leadership Vacancy Hypothesis," the lack of Operating Room leadership could threaten the facilityâ€™s overall operating margin. However due to lack of data, HealthLinx<sup>&reg;</sup> is unable to monetize this risk in this analysis.
	</p>

	<p>
		As noted in the CMS View, there is a possibly significant annual positive financial impact in the Emergency Room if "Left before being seen"(LWOBS) could be reduced to the State Mean and Length of Stay were to be reduced.

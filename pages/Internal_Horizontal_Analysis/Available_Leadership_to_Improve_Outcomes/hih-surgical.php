	<h1 class="title">
		Operating Room ("OR")
	</h1>

	<p>
		As was noted in the "Leadership Vacancy Hypotheses" section, the OR appears to be severely underperforming in all three domains from lack of an OR Director and an OR manager.
	</p>

	<p>
		This presents particular concern because:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			It's a mathematical drag on the Vertical Outcome threshold needed for Magnet
		</li>
		<li>
			From a CMS perspective, specifically "Timely &amp; Effective Care," the "Incidence of potentially preventable VTE" is over 3 times greater than the State Mean
		</li>
		<li>
			It is most likely a revenue and margin threat to the facility due to the importance of the OR to both revenue and margin
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Again, the last viable quarter to implement a leadership change to affect data is Q4 '16. The sooner the hypothesized leadership problem is resolved, the sooner changes can be implemented and data affected positively.
	</p>

	<p>
		With that said, the following leaders are available.
	</p>

	<p>
		First, HealthLinx<sup>&reg;</sup> could have the following Transitional Leader [#158553] onsite in as few as 5 days.
	</p>

	<a class="over-auto no-style" href="#">
		<div class="card blue">
			<span class="title">Director of Surgical Services</span>
			<span class="desc">RN, BSN, MSN/MBA</span>
		</div>
	</a>

	<p>
		Quick Highlights:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			MSN, required for Magnet<sup>&reg;</sup>
		</li>
		<li>
			Increased Patient Satisfaction, which is critically needed here
		</li>
		<li>
			Implemented team building, which is again needed here for RN engagement
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Second, HealthLinx<sup>&reg;</sup> could provide a Permanent Leader. The following Permanent Leader [#164906] is provided as both immediately available and as an example of the type of Permanent Leader that could be acquired to move the Operating Room towards better outcomes and financial performance.
	</p>

	<a class="over-auto no-style" href="#">
		<div class="card purple">
			<span class="title">Director of Surgical Services</span>
			<span class="desc">MSN, BSN</span>
		</div>
	</a>

	<p>
		Third, the following is one of many case studies evidencing HealthLinx<sup>&reg;</sup>â€™s ability to improve ORs.
	</p>

	<a class="no-style over-auto" href="#">
		<div class="case-study">
			<span class="title">
				Director O.R.<br />
				TL - 4353
			</span>
		</div>
	</a>

	<p>
		Finally, we can provide frontline nurse manager leadership.
	</p>

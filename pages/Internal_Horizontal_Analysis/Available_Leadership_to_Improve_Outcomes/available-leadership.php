	<h1 class="title">
		Available Leadership
	</h1>

	<p>
		The Available Leadership section is provided to offer the facility immediate, in as few as five days, and long-term solutions to identified Horizontal/Unit-level leadership challenges.
	</p>

	<p>
		With limited time to affect the data, for this facility the last actionable quarter being Q4 2016, strong leadership can often have an immediate and positive impact and in some cases is enough to meet the threshold.
	</p>

	<p>
		Per ULSO and as noted earlier, 15 of the 29 units (52%) required to report outperformed. Therefore, the facility has met and outperformed the requirement that 50% of a facilityâ€™s units are outperforming the benchmark more than 50% of the time for the most recent eight (8) quarters.
	</p>

	<p>
		However, due the fact it only outperforms by a small margin of 2% and new data may negatively affect the final measurement, it is highly recommended to further investigate all Horizontal hypotheses to maximize outperformance. As noted in the Unit-Level Director Summary, outperformance could be as high as 93%.
	</p>

	<p>
		The following subsections explore available Leadership options:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Behavior Health (Currently Vacant &amp; Underperforming)
		</li>
		<li>
			Operating Room Director &amp; Nurse Manager (Currently both Vacant, Underperforming &amp; Flagged in the CMS Data)
		</li>
		<li>Critical Care (Vertical RN Satisfaction appears to be negatively affected)
		</li>
		<li>
			Emergency Department (Large Financial Impact Noted)
		</li>
		<li>
			Home Health Manager (Currently Vacant but not required to report)
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		If the Operating Room &amp; Behavior Health data could be affected positively with immediate leadership, an additional 2 units outperforming could move this facility to better performance in its pursuit of excellence, and 17 (instead of 15) units of 29 could theoretically be out performing the mean an increase from 52% to 59%. A higher margin would represent insurance as new data is processed.

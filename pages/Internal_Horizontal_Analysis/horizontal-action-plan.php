		Horizontal Action Plan &amp; Viable Quarter
	</h1>

	<p>
		In summary, Facilty exceeds the threshold by a small margin of 2%.
	</p>

	<p>
		However, it is highly recommended that Facility explore the Vacancy and Underperformance hypotheses presented herein. By actively mitigating these potential Horizontal challenges, Facility could far exceed the threshold and move from overperformance in 15 out of 29 units (52%) to 26 out of 29 units (93%). More importantly, pursuit of solutions in these areas would represent constant pursuit of excellence and could be “insurance” against any decline in the data through Q4 of 2016.
	</p>

	<p>
		Investigating and operationilizing these Horiztontal hypotheses will take significant time.
	</p>

	<p>
		The last viable quarter to draft a completed action plan for the above is Q3 of 2016.
	</p>

	<p>
		The last viable quarter to implement the action plan is Q4 of 2016.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is recommended not to wait for the last quarter. Again, leadership changes take time to complete and take effect.
	</p>

	<p>
		A list of available leaders is included in the NEAP.
	</p>

	<p>
		Once these dates are past, new data will not be able to be utilized in the calculation.

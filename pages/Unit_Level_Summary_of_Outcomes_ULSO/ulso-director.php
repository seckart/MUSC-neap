	<p>
		The "Director View" is designed to summarize Director-level performance. It is different in one way from the "Executive View" in that it cohorts units by Director.

					<li>High &amp; low-performing Directors overall and by domain</li>

		This view offers the ability to begin to formulate hypotheses around Director Leadership and corresponding action planning.
	</p>


	<p>
		With regard to this facility, the following broad hypotheses can be formulated:
	</p>


	<ul>
		<li>
			The lack of leadership/vacancies is having a negative effect on performance. This hypothetical correction, holding all else constant, would significantly help facility to improve its outperformance of 52% (15 out of 29 units) to 69% (20 out of 29 units). Such a move would defend against outperformance erosion elsewhere.
		</li>
		<li>
			Solving underperformance in units 102, 104, 106, 108, 110 &amp; 144, 149-151 could move over performance to 72%
		</li>
		<li>
			Combining the above could move over performance to 93%.
		</li>
		<li>
			In addition, the hypothetical correction of either lack of frontline manager leadership or stretch coverage in units 111-115 could help improve the domain of RN Satisfaction, the only current underperforming domain.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The "Quarterly View", or "Q View", is not a summary view. Like the Unit-Level view, it is designed to give a wealth of information in each of the domains and allow the user to dive deeper into the data, specifically trending.
	</p>

	<p>
		This view offers the ability to begin to refine earlier Vertical and Horizontal hypotheses. For example, a Horizontal inquiry into this rich data may be: have leadership changes in the last 8 quarters shown trends upward or downward. A similar Vertical inquiry may be made. For example, have steps to reduce Falls made an improvement?
	</p>

	<p>
		With regard to this facility and this view, no hypothesis is put forward at this time.

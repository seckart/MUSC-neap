	<p>
		The "Executive View" is designed to quickly summarize Vertical and Horizontal performance. It is different in two ways from the other views. First, it sorts from highest performing unit to lowest performing unit. Second, it collapses the domains allowing the reader to quickly see overall performance (the "All" column), RN Satisfaction, Patient Satisfaction and NSIs.

		This view offers the ability to begin to formulate hypotheses on risk, barriers, performance and corresponding action planning.
	</p>


	<p>
		With regard to this facility, the following broad hypotheses can be formulated:
	</p>


	<ul>
		<li>
			15 of the 29 units (52%) required to report outperformed. Therefore, the facility has exceeded the requirement that 50% of a facilityâ€™s units are outperforming the benchmark more than 50% of the time for the most recent eight (8) quarters. However, due the fact it only outperforms by a small margin of 2% and new data may negatively affect the final measurement, it is highly recommended to further investigate all Horizontal hypotheses to maximize outperformance. As noted in the Unit-Level Director Summary, overperformance could be as high as 93%.
		</li>
		<li>
			From a Vertical perspective, of the three domains, RN satisfaction performs less well than the other two.
		</li>
		<li>
			From a Horizontal perspective, the six vacant leadership positions in the bottom 20% of the units appear to be significantly hurting performance in all three domains and are putting a significant drag on reaching the threshold.
		</li>
	</ul>

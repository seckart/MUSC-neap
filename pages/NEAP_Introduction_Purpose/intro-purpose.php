<strong class="font-size-875">Nursing Excellence Assessment and Plan - NEAP</strong>

<p>
	The primary purpose of the Nursing Excellence Assessment and Plan ("NEAP") is to identify existing Vertical and Horizontal barriers and/or potential risks to the pursuit of nursing excellence.
</p>

<p>
	A critical measurement, per the ANCC<sup>&reg;</sup>'s Magnet<sup>&reg;</sup> Office, and major threshold the Outcome Team will continually focus on during this project, is whether or not 50% of a facility's units are outperforming the benchmark more than 50% of the time for the most recent eight (8) quarters.

<p>
	The NEAP includes 2 days of onsite evaluations by a HealthLinx<sup>&reg;</sup> Vice President of Nursing Excellence ("VPNE"). During this onsite, the VPNE, Analytics meets with all levels of nursing within the facility to gain a comprehensive, first-hand perspective of key systems and operations. Over 40 specific documents and policies are evaluated in parallel to a comprehensive quality outcome assessment (the HealthLinx<sup>&reg;</sup> Unit-Level Summary of Outcomes [“ULSO”]) encompassing over 100 assessment hours.
</p>

<p>
	At the conclusion of the NEAP, a 2nd onsite visit is confirmed to present the NEAP report. This report, presented electronically, matches identified risks and leadership challenges with a project plan, timeline, and resources. The ULSO is a key component of the NEAP assessment. It establishes the foundation for the project plan and is a predictable indicator of an organization’s ability to demonstrate excellence.
</p>

<p>
	The NEAP assessment is an essential component in an organization’s pursuit of nursing excellence because it:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reduces risk of failure for organizations pursuing the Magnet<sup>&reg;</sup> Recognition Award by utilizing the ULSO to create realistic timelines</li>
	<li>Identifies leadership effectiveness as evidenced by unit-level quality outcomes (RN and Patient Satisfaction, Nurse-sensitive indicators), again utilizing the ULSO</li>
	<li>Creates a sustainable culture of excellence by establishing a path with realistic expectations and goals</li>
	<li>Outlines a project plan and timeline for pursing the Pathway to Excellence Award or the Magnet<sup>&reg;</sup> Recognition Award.</li>
</ul>
